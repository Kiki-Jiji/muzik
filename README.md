# Muzik

A web app that interacts with the Spotify api to do ..... stuff?

## Getting Started

Clone the repo to your local computer. Then `cd` into the repo and run `npm install`. This will install the node_modules and other react libraries specified in `package.json`. Then you can run `npm start` and the react app will open on port:3000, it should automatically open but if not then navigate to the correct port by entering in a browser `localhost:3000`

## Prerequistes

**You’ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

**Node** can be [downloaded here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
